1. Run the app in the help=noprompt mode without app.def and no
   settings.  The printed values should be the factory defaults.

2. app help=noprompt <key>=<val> should print <val> for corresponding
   <key> on commandline and factory defaults for everything else.

3. app help=def should return an error.

4. Setup app.def.  Run app.  Should return the settings for keys found
   in app.def and factory defaults for everything else.

5. app help=def should work as if app help=prompt and the "go" command
   is used.

6. app help=def,tt.def should return error

7. Setup tt.def with some key settings missing.  app help=def,tt.def
   should return the settings of keys found in tt.def and factory
   defaults for everything else.

8. app followed by "load <file>!" should set all keys found in <file>
   that were not already set (complement load).  "keys that were not
   already set" really means keys that take string values and are
   currently blank.  All other keys would be set one way or another --
   either as factory defaults, or via app.def or via user interaction.

9. Test for app help=defdbg

10. Test for app help=params.  Verify the output format and the
    various tokens.
